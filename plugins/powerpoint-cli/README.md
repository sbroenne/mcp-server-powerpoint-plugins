# PowerPoint CLI Agent Plugin

Windows-only PowerPoint automation for coding agents through `powerpointcli`.

The plugin installs the `powerpoint-cli` Agent Skill and a small bootstrap. On first use, the
bootstrap downloads the matching self-contained runtime from the latest
[`sbroenne/mcp-server-powerpoint`](https://github.com/sbroenne/mcp-server-powerpoint/releases)
release. The runtime is cached per user and verified against the release `SHA256SUMS` file.

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or later
- Microsoft PowerPoint desktop
- Windows PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell 7
- Network access for the first runtime download

After one verified download, the cached runtime remains available during temporary network
outages. A cold cache fails with a clear error instead of running unverified code.

## Installation

```text
copilot plugin install sbroenne/mcp-server-powerpoint-plugins/powerpoint-cli
```

## What it supports

- Presentation create, open, test, list, and save-on-close
- Slides, sections, comments, backgrounds, and imports
- Shapes, placeholders, text formatting, and hyperlinks
- Tables, native charts, SmartArt, images, and speaker notes
- Layouts, masters, page setup, accessibility, and animation
- PDF and image export for delivery and visual verification

## Typical workflow

```powershell
$session = powerpointcli session create C:\Decks\demo.pptx | ConvertFrom-Json
powerpointcli slide add-blank -s $session.sessionId
powerpointcli shape add-text-box -s $session.sessionId --slide-index 1 `
  --left 50 --top 50 --width 600 --height 80
powerpointcli session close $session.sessionId --save
```

Run `powerpointcli --help` and `powerpointcli <command> --help` for the authoritative command
surface.

## Runtime safety

- Release archives and cached archives are checked against `SHA256SUMS`.
- Downloads use a temporary `.part` file and staged extraction.
- A per-user mutex serializes installs.
- An existing runtime is replaced only after the new runtime passes version checks.
- A runtime currently in use is never overwritten.
- Release checks use GitHub authentication when `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` is available.

The plugin contains no PowerPoint documents and does not upload presentation content.
